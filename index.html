    <p>I made this one over christmas and it hit <em>juuust</em> right!</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong><a href="./chicken/instapotchicken.html">Instant Pot Chicken and Rice</a></strong></p>
    <p>After years of bland unflavored rice I finally learned how good rice could be with this recipe!</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong><a href="./beef/chili.html">Gameday Chili</a></strong></p>
    <p>Chili is one of my all time favorite comfort foods. The first time I used this particular recipe I made it with moose meat and it was SO good</p>
