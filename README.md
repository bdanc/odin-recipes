# odin-recipes
This project is mainly a test of my HTML abilities to this point and also put more practice into using github
It will be a very basic website only using HTML but I will return later to style it with CSS
This website will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes, demonstrating usage of relative links and basic page structure.
